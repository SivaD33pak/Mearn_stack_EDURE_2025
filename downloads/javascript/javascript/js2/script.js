//Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated 
//using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in 
//meters).

//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 
//called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn. 
//2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two 
//variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn. 
//3. Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

// improve it: 
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The 
// message can be either: 
// "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!". 
// 2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the 
// outputs. 
// Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI 
// (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!". 
// Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

// There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy! 
// Your tasks: 
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below. 
// The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, 
// and the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable. 
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
// and print to the console: 
// "Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or 
// "Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or 
// "Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal. 
// Test data:  
// • Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110  
// • Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123  
// • Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

// Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant. 
// In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value 
// is different, the tip is 20%. 
// Your tasks: 
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called tip for 
// this. It's not allowed to use an if...else statement (if it's easier for you, you can 
// start with an if...else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
// operator). 
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final 
// value (bill + tip). 
// Example: The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25. 
// Note: Use the values of the bill and tip variables to construct this string. Don't 
// hard-code them       
// TEST DATA: Test with different bill values: 275, 40, and 430

let bill = 430;
