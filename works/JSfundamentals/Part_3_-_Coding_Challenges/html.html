<!-- Your tasks:  
1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and  
'players2'). In the given data -- players array contains 2 arrays in it.First array 
contains team 1 players and second array contains team 2 players. 
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field 
players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable (gk) with the 
goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field 
players  
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)  
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a 
new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 
'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'  
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called  
'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')  
6. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which 
team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary 
operator.  
GOOD LUCK 😀  -->
